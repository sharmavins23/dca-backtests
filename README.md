# Dollar-Cost-Averaging Backtests

I've never played around with investing backtests, and as I was getting into
some investing principles, I felt it would be interesting to compare and
contrast a variety of investing strategies (month-to-month, for long-term
investing only!) with each other.

The sample scenario is simple: An investor receives $5,000 monthly and can
either invest in a particular (ETF) stock or hold it in a more liquid money
market fund (using historical federal reserve board data for interest rates). At
the end of the several-year run, which strategy gains the most net worth?

Gains are aggregated and tested on a variety of differing strategies. All prices
for buying and selling shares are based on the market's adjusted close value.
